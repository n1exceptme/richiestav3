This is a rest api demo written in the client side using ExtJS, and the server side written in PHP.

If you would like to run it on your own machine.

go to mysql admin. create a database, and import the mysql file attached.

in this application content, go to php and update your dabase credentials at php/QueryOperation.php @ constructor.

If you would like to either place the php content somewhere else, update app/store/MapStore.js @ router.

:) hope you enjoy this humble demo
